--prompt 'A stylish woman strolls down a bustling Tokyo street, the warm glow of neon lights and animated city signs casting vibrant reflections. She wears a sleek black leather jacket paired with a flowing red dress and black boots, her black purse slung over her shoulder. Sunglasses perched on her nose and a bold red lipstick add to her confident, casual demeanor. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror-like effect that enhances the colorful lights and shadows. Pedestrians move about, adding to the lively atmosphere. The scene is captured in a dynamic medium shot with the woman walking slightly to one side, highlighting her graceful strides.' \
