## 🐧 Linux Environment Setup

### 🐳 Docker Environment (Recommended)

We strongly recommend using the Docker environment, which is the simplest and fastest installation method.

#### 1. Pull Image

Visit LightX2V's [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lightx2v/lightx2v/tags), select a tag with the latest date, such as `25111101-cu128`:

```bash
docker pull lightx2v/lightx2v:25111101-cu128
```

We recommend using the `cuda128` environment for faster inference speed. If you need to use the `cuda124` environment, you can use image versions with the `-cu124` suffix:

```bash
docker pull lightx2v/lightx2v:25101501-cu124
```

#### 2. Run Container

```bash
docker run --gpus all -itd --ipc=host --name [container_name] -v [mount_settings] --entrypoint /bin/bash [image_id]
```

#### 3. China Mirror Source (Optional)

For mainland China, if the network is unstable when pulling images, you can pull from Alibaba Cloud:

```bash
# cuda128
docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/yongyang/lightx2v:25111101-cu128

# cuda124
docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/yongyang/lightx2v:25101501-cu124
```

#### Step 5: Verify Installation

```python
import lightx2v
print(f"LightX2V Version: {lightx2v.__version__}")
```

## 🪟 Windows Environment Setup

Windows systems only support Conda environment setup. Please follow these steps:

### 🐍 Conda Environment Setup

#### Step 1: Check CUDA Version

First, confirm your GPU driver and CUDA version:

```cmd
nvidia-smi
```

Record the **CUDA Version** information in the output, which needs to be consistent in subsequent installations.

#### Step 2: Create Python Environment

```cmd
# Create new environment (Python 3.12 recommended)
conda create -n lightx2v python=3.12 -y

# Activate environment
conda activate lightx2v
```

> 💡 **Note**: Python 3.10 or higher is recommended for best compatibility.

#### Step 3: Install PyTorch Framework

**Method 1: Download Official Wheel Package (Recommended)**

1. Visit the [PyTorch Official Download Page](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch/)
2. Select the corresponding version wheel package, paying attention to matching:
   - **Python Version**: Consistent with your environment
   - **CUDA Version**: Matches your GPU driver
   - **Platform**: Select Windows version

**Example (Python 3.12 + PyTorch 2.6 + CUDA 12.4):**

```cmd
# Download and install PyTorch
pip install torch-2.6.0+cu124-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl

# Install supporting packages
pip install torchvision==0.21.0 torchaudio==2.6.0
```

**Method 2: Direct Installation via pip**

```cmd
# CUDA 12.4 version example
pip install torch==2.6.0+cu124 torchvision==0.21.0+cu124 torchaudio==2.6.0+cu124 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

#### Step 4: Install Windows Version vLLM

Download the corresponding wheel package from [vllm-windows releases](https://github.com/SystemPanic/vllm-windows/releases).

**Version Matching Requirements:**
- Python version matching
- PyTorch version matching
- CUDA version matching

```cmd
# Install vLLM (please adjust according to actual filename)
pip install vllm-0.9.1+cu124-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl
```

#### Step 5: Install Attention Mechanism Operators
